# Automating-Lead-Management-with-Apify-and-Make.com

Task 1: Case Study â€“ Lead Management Automation
Background

A digital marketing agency needed to streamline its lead generation process. The main challenge was automating the transfer and enrichment of business contact data extracted from Google Maps using Apify, and organizing it for efficient outreach.
Objective

    Automate the transfer of extracted leads into a structured database.

    Integrate Apify with Make.com and Google Sheets.

    Enhance data accuracy and enable further enrichment for outreach campaigns.

Implementation Steps

    1. Apify Actor Monitoring

        Configured Make.com to monitor the Apify actor (Google Maps Email Extractor) for completion.

        Extracted key data: company names, email addresses, phone numbers, and locations.

    2. Automating Data Transfer

        Created a Make.com scenario to fetch new lead data upon completion of the Apify process.

        Cleaned and formatted the data to ensure consistency and remove duplicates.

    3. Lead Enrichment

        Integrated an additional scraper to extract extra email addresses from business websites.

        Collected alternative contact information to improve outreach success rates.

    4. Google Sheets Integration

        Automatically pushed structured and enriched data to a Google Sheet.

        Ensured real-time updates and systematic appending of new leads.

        Enabled sales and marketing teams to analyze and prioritize leads efficiently.

    Note: For demonstration, only 5 leads were extracted and processed.

Task 2: Brand Information Extraction and Content Generation

    Used the extracted lead data from Google Sheets to identify two brands.

    Developed a Python script to scrape the "About Us" or general brand information from the official websites of these brands.

    Identified niche-related keywords from the brand descriptions.

    Generated content based on these keywords for targeted outreach.
